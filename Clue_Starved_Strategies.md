* Link: https://hanabi-competitions.com/competitions/2020-11-23%202p%20Clue%20Starved%20(6%20Suits)

### General Strategies
* Do NOT give *1-for-1 Save Clues* if the `future required efficiency is greater than 1.25 OR greater than 1.00 AND the card is one-away from locked`. In this situation, use the *Skipped Discard Chop Move*.
* Do NOT give *1-for-1 Play Clues* (on a card which is not on Chop) if the `future required efficiency is greater than 1.00`, including the Self Color Bluffs.
* If the `pace is equal or smaller than 1`, you are allowed to give a *1-for-1 Play Clue* even if the future required efficiency is greater than 1.00.
* Do NOT *Chop Move* a two-away 3 or 4.
* Do NOT *Chop Move* a one-away 3 or 4 unless your teammate has at least two playable cards or at least two trash followed behind.
* Do NOT do *Fake Saves* on non-critical 3 or 4.
* Do NOT lock your teammate’s hand. (See more strategies below)
* It is illegal to do a *Self Color Bluff* by touching a brand-new card, including a *Chop Move* card. Unless, it is globally known not to be playable.
* You can do a *Self Color Bluff* if your teammate’s Chop is on their *Finessed Position* (*Finessed Chop*), no matter how low the required efficiency is.
* *Tempo Clue Chop Moves* is always turned on.
* *Double Tempo Clue* is turned off, which means it is also a *Tempo Clue Chop Move*.
* *Occupied Play Clue* and *Loaded Play Clue* are turned off.
* *Overloaded Play Clue* and *Double Loaded Play Clue* are turned on.
* *Double Ignition* is turned on. (Re-touching a trash, for example)

### Lock Hand Strategies
* Situation: If your teammate has four clued cards and they draw a useful card which is not playable. (Their *Chop* is on the *Finessed Position*)
* Main Strategy: Do NOT lock your teammate.
* Reason: We don’t have enough clues to stall in Clue Starved.
* What should you do in this situation?
  * Option 0: Do the *Tempo Clue Chop Move*.
(If your teammate doesn’t have playable cards, see the options below)
  * Option 1: Kill it
    * If it is a non-critical 2
    * If it is a 5
    * If it is a critical 2, 3, or 4 and their connecting cards are dead
  * Option 2: Do the *Skipped Discard Chop Move* and “lock” your teammate
    * If it is a critical 2
    * If it is a critical 3
    * If it is a critical 4 and your teammate has an unplayable 5
  * Option 3: Choose either option 1 or 2
(option 1 is better than 2 in most situation since you might discard another critical card while doing a *Skipped Discard Chop Move*)
    * If it is a critical 4 and your teammate doesn’t have an unplayable 5
* How should you respond if your teammate “locks” you?
  * 1st Priority: Sacrifice one of your clued cards which is globally-known non-critical.
  * 2nd Priority: Sacrifice one of your clued cards with highest rank, a 5 for example.
  * 3rd Priority: Blind-play a clued card which is likely to be playable.
  * Note that if you want your teammate to blind-play the correct slot, use *Chop Overflow Finesse*.
* What can you do if your teammate has a playable card on their *Finessed Chop* while you don’t have a clue (or you don’t want to waste a clue)?
  * Option 1: Perform a *Double Chop Move* as a *Chop Overflow Finesse* and force them to blind-play.
  * Option 2: Perform a *Single Chop Move* and force them to discard a globally-known non-critical card.
  * Option 3: Kill it if it is not critical. (In an emergency situation, you shouldn’t mark *Elimination Notes* if your teammate kills your non-critical playable card.)
* What can you do if your teammate has a critical card on their *Finessed Chop* but they have some other playable card in hand while you don’t have a clue to do the Tempo Clue Chop Move?
  * Option 1: Perform a *Single Chop Move* and force your teammate to discard.
  * Option 2: Perform a *Chop Overflow Finesse* and tell your teammate which card to play.
  * Option 3: Kill it.

### New Conventions
#### 1-for-1 Play Clue Chop Move
* If only one card which is not on Chop is touched by a direct *Play Clue*, while the `future required efficiency is greater than 1.00`. It is not only a *Play Clue* on that card but also a *(Single) Chop Move*.
* Note that if a clue touches a brand-new card and another card which has been chop moved, it is NOT a *1-for-1 Play Clue Chop Move*, since the chop moved cards are treated as untouched cards.
* Note that it is illegal to do a *1-for-1 Self Color Bluff* if your teammate’s *Chop* is not on their *Finessed Position*. If someone does that, it is a signal as a *1-for-1 Play Clue Chop Move*.
* Exception: If a *1-for-1 Play Clue* is given touching a critical 1, 2 or 3 which is one-away-from-chop, it doesn’t *Chop Move*.
(Reason: It is because the team might lose it if they do a *Skipped Discard Chop Move*.)

#### Oops Chop Move
* If a player discards a critical card from Chop and it is not an emergency situation, it is a signal as an *Oops Chop Move* on the card which moves to *Chop*.
#### Unnecessary Trash Push
* *Trash Pushes* are always unnecessary, which means they should blind-play the card from their *Finessed Position* after blind-playing the pushed card. You can only perform this move if the `future required efficiency is greater than 1.00`.
#### Unnecessary Trash Pull
* Similar to *Unnecessary Trash Push*.
#### Rank Identity Change
* If a 5 is discarded, a critical 4 of that suit is treated as a 5.
* Meanwhile, if one of the 3s, two 4s and a 5 of the same suit are all discarded. It is a 1-for-1 Play Clue Chop Move if someone gives a Play Clue touching a critical 3 of that suit which is one-away-from-chop.
