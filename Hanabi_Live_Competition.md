# Welcome Hanabi Live Competitors!
* Hosted by [IAMJEFF](https://github.com/iamwhoiamhahaha) and [Dr_Kakashi](https://github.com/Dr-Kakashi)

### Mission
Our goal is to have weekly competitions to have teams compete against one another playing Hanabi with identical decks.  These are special challenges that will bring a competitive atmosphere where anyone can join to show off their skills.  

### Standard Scoring
* Game points = Total Max Score + Bonus Points
* Bonus Points = (# of cards left in the deck + # of clues left) * 0.1
  * Example:
You score 24 points with 3 cards remaining in deck and have 2 clues.
Total Max Score = 24
Bonus Points = 3 + 2 = 5 * 0.1 = 0.5
Game Points = 24 + 0.5 = 24.5
* A bombed deck (3 strikes) will only score the points they’ve received up to that point
  * Example
You score 10 points, but received a 3rd strike to end the game.  Game Points will be 10 and no bonus points will be awarded.  
Thus, you are more inclined to complete a game as you will receive bonus points for doing so. 
* Special Rules:  Depending on the event we may specify specials rules that will be stated in the event’s description

### Victory Points
* The number of victory points a team receives will be the average of their best 3 out of 4 games.
  * Example:
You played 4 games and received scores of 20, 25, 18, 14
Total Victory Points = 20 + 25 + 18 = 21
This is setup such that a really bad game doesn’t destroy the team’s success/chance.  It really gives you 1 warmup game essentially.

### Standard Rules
1.	All players welcomed.
2.	No table talking once a game has started, until it is finished.
3.	No seeing decks before the contest. We will present seeds on day of competition.
4.	No looking at another team’s scores before you play.
5.	No quitting or restarting.  We can verify by looking at your profile
6.	Do not post your scores before the contest ends.
7.	We will give 24 hours to complete the challenge on day of event, so everyone around the whole world are encouraged to participate.
