### General Strategies

* Do **not** give *1-for-1 Play Clues*. (See more strategies below)
* Do **not** give *1-for-1 Save Clues*. (See more strategies below)
* Do **not** *Chop Move* two-away 3s or 4s.
* Do **not** *Chop Move* one-away 3s or 4s unless your teammate has at least two playable cards or at least two trash followed behind.
* Do **not** *Fake Save* non-critical 3s or 4s.
* Do **not** *Lock* your teammate’s hand. (See more strategies below)
* It is **illegal** to do a *Self Color Bluff* by touching a brand-new card, including a *Chop Move* card. Unless, it is globally known not to be playable.
* *Tempo Clue Chop Moves* are always turned **on**.
* *Double Tempo Clues* are turned **off**, which means it is also a *Tempo Clue Chop Move*.
* *Occupied Play Clues* and *Loaded Play Clues* are turned **off**.
* *Overloaded Play Clues* and *Double Loaded Play Clues* are turned **on**.
* *Double Ignitions* are turned **on**. (Re-touching a trash, for example)

### Lock Hand Strategies

* Situation: If your teammate has four clued cards and they draw a useful card which is not playable. (Their *Chop* is on the *Finessed Position*)
* Main Strategy: Do **not** lock your teammate.
* Reason: We don’t have enough clues to stall in Clue Starved.
* What should you do in this situation?
  * Option 0: Do the *Tempo Clue Chop Move*.
(If your teammate doesn’t have playable cards, see the options below)
  * Option 1: Kill it
    * If it is a non-critical 2
    * If it is a 5
    * If it is a critical 2, 3, or 4 and their connecting cards are dead
  * Option 2: Do the *Skipped Discard Chop Move* and “lock” your teammate
    * If it is a critical 2
    * If it is a critical 3
    * If it is a critical 4 and your teammate has an unplayable 5
  * Option 3: Choose either option 1 or 2
(option 1 is better than 2 in most situation since you might discard another critical card while doing a *Skipped Discard Chop Move*)
    * If it is a critical 4 and your teammate doesn’t have an unplayable 5
* How should you respond if your teammate “locks” you?
  * 1st Priority: Sacrifice one of your clued cards which is globally-known non-critical.
  * 2nd Priority: Sacrifice one of your clued cards with highest rank, a 5 for example.
  * 3rd Priority: Blind-play a clued card which is likely to be playable.
  * Note that if you want your teammate to blind-play the correct slot, use *Chop Overflow Finesse*.
* What can you do if your teammate has a playable card on their *Finessed Chop* while you don’t have a clue (or you don’t want to waste a clue)?
  * Option 1: Perform a *Double Chop Move* as a *Chop Overflow Finesse* and force them to blind-play.
  * Option 2: Perform a *Single Chop Move* and force them to discard a globally-known non-critical card.
  * Option 3: Kill it if it is not critical. (In an emergency situation, you shouldn’t mark *Elimination Notes* if your teammate kills your non-critical playable card.)
* What can you do if your teammate has a critical card on their *Finessed Chop* but they have some other (unknown) playable cards in hand while you don’t have a clue to do the *Tempo Clue Chop Move*?
  * Option 1: Perform a *Single Chop Move* and force your teammate to discard.
  * Option 2: Perform a *Chop Overflow Finesse* and tell your teammate which card to play.
  * Option 3: Kill it.

### 1-for-1 Clue Strategies

#### 1-for-1 Play Clues
* You are not allowed to give *1-for-1 Play Clues* if the future required efficiency is greater than **1.00**, including the *1-for-1 Self Color Bluffs*.
* However, in these situation you are allowed to give *1-for-1 Play Clues*:
  * If the card is on *Chop*
  * If the card is on *Finessed Chop*
  * If the pace is less than or equal to **1**

#### 1-for-1 Save Clues
* You are not allow to give *1-for-1 Save Clues* if the future required efficiency is greater than **1.25** OR greater than **1.00** AND your teammate is one-away from locked.
* In this situation, use either *Tempo Clue Chop Moves* or *Skipped Discard Chop Moves*.

#### 1-for-1 Play Clues Chop Move
* If only **one** card which is not on *Chop* is touched by a direct *Play Clue*, while the future required efficiency is greater than **1.00**. It is not only a *Play Clue* on that card but also a *Chop Move*.
* Note that if a clue touches a brand-new card and another card which has been chop moved, it is NOT a *1-for-1 Play Clue Chop Move*, since the chop moved cards are treated as untouched cards.
* Note that it is illegal to do a *1-for-1 Self Color Bluff* if your teammate’s *Chop* is not on their *Finessed Position*. If someone does that, it is a signal as a *1-for-1 Play Clue Chop Move*.
* Exception: It is **legal** to give a *1-for-1 Play Clue* on a critical 1, 2 or 3 which is one-away-from-chop, and it doesn’t *Chop Move*.
(Reason: It is because the team might lose it if your teammate does a *Skipped Discard Chop Move*.)

### More Strategies

#### Oops Chop Move
* If a player discards a critical card from *Chop* and it is not an emergency situation, it is a signal as an *Oops Chop Move* on the card which moves to the *Chop*.

#### Unnecessary Trash Push
* *Trash Pushes* are always unnecessary, which means they should blind-play the card from their *Finessed Position* after blind-playing the pushed card.
* Note that:
  * If the clue giver has **2** or more loaded actions and pace is greater than **1**, then the trash push is unnecessary
  * If required efficiency is greater than **1.00** and the clue would normally cause a 1-for-1 chop move, then the trash push is unnecessary
  * If the clue receiver knows/finds out that the card could've been clued directly, then the trash push is unecessary
  * If both the clue receiver and the clue giver have at least **1** loaded action, then the trash push is unnecessary
* Exception: if it is the mid-game and required efficiency is not greater than **1.00** and the clue receiver has no finesse position after the trash push then it is sufficiently valuable to give 1 known trash and it does not mean anything extra

#### Unnecessary Trash Pull
* Similar to *Unnecessary Trash Push*.

#### Rank Identity Change
* If a 5 is discarded, a critical 4 of that suit is treated as a 5.
* Meanwhile, if one of the 3s, two 4s and a 5 of the same suit are all discarded. It is a 1-for-1 Play Clue Chop Move if someone gives a *Play Clue* touching a critical 3 of that suit which is one-away-from-chop.
